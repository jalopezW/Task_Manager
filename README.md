# Task_Manager

A task manager project utizling data structures, and I/O that I created during summer because I was bored and wanted to locally manage my daily tasks.

To get this program to work you must get your own gemini api key from this [link](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
Then, create a .env file named "my_api_key.env" where this program is cloned and paste your gemini api key into the file.
Ex: GEMINI_API_KEY=1234567890ABC
